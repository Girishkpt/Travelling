        <p class="p4">There is a rock phase to climb which is of 75 to 80 degrees inclination. This rock is a bit unsteady. You have to keep one leg at a time. If you are trekking in a group, one team member can climb first and help others.</p>

        <h1>➤ Best Time to Visit Ettina Bhuja</h1>
        <p class="p5">The best time to do the Ettina Bhuja trek is the post-monsoon season. Ettina Bhuja from Bhairaveshwara temple is accessible anytime after the monsoon (from September to February).

            If you are trekking from Shishila village, you can do it only after October as the current of Kapila river will be high.
            
            During the monsoon season, the trail becomes slippery. As a result, the final section of the trail becomes very difficult to climb. In summer, it becomes too hot and you will not get to see the real beauty of the Charmadi range.</p>
